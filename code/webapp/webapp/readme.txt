	This is a Flask web application designed to graph dynamically graph the data from the temperature sensors deployed in Bliss Hall. The flask_route_ex.py file executes the application. The user can then select the rooms and input a time frame to generate a chart. It can also create charts of the average temperature data of each floor side by side, based on the user provided start and stop times.
